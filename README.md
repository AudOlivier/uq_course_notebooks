Notebooks for graduate course on Uncertainty Quantification

First you need to download Anaconda, see the AnacondaInstall file for a walk-through (installation, setting up a conda environment, downloading specific packages and creating a new Jupyter notebook). Most notebooks in this folder require packages scipy, numpy and matplotlib to run.

In order to download all notebooks, click on the green "Code" button and do "Download ZIP". In order to download a single notebook, go to the notebook, right-click on "Raw" then do "Download Linked File As..." and save the file wherever you want on your computer.
